[technology-name]
water-processing=Ice processing
advanced-metallic-asteroid-crushing=Advanced metallic asteroid crushing

[technology-description]
water-processing=Ice processing lets you turn ice into usable water.
rail-support-foundations=Allows to build support foundations for elevated rails.
advanced-metallic-asteroid-crushing=This cutting-edge technology allows for the extraction of additional copper from metallic asteroid chunks. However, this process comes at a cost, yielding less iron. By optimizing our methods, we can ensure a more efficient use of these valuable resources.
planet-discovery-vulcanus=A hot volcanic planet with mountainous valcanoes, rivers of lava, plains of ash, and sulfuric acid geysers. Rich in metals.
planet-discovery-gleba=A humid swampy planet with nutrient-rich bogs.
planet-discovery-fulgora= A dry wind-swept planet with lightning storms on plateaus, and oceans of oil.
yumako=The Yumako tree, once a symbol of abundance, is now extinct. Its tasty and nutritious fruits are a distant memory, found only on ancient asteroid fragments. This technology leverages the remnants of Yumako for sustainable, nutrient-rich food production.
jellynut=Once a stunning sight, the Jellystem tree has vanished from our world. The only way to obtain the rare Jellynuts now is by harvesting from the remnants found on a solitary asteroid. This technology allows us to carefully extract and preserve these precious nuts for their unique properties.
elevated-rail=Raised rail that can be placed over obstacles or empty space to reach new areas or make more effeicient rail networks.

platformer-intro=Platformer
platformer-surface-condition=What can I build?

[tips-and-tricks-item-description]
platformer-intro=You are currently stranded on your platform, with no way to descend to the surface of the planets in the solar system. Fortunately, you've discovered a way to survive and advance your technological research from the space platform. You can gather resources by collecting asteroid chunks with the [entity=asteroid-collector] and crushing them in the [entity=crusher]. Each planet has its own unique set of specific chunks.\nOn [planet=nauvis], you will find: \n[item=metallic-asteroid-chunk], which can be crushed for [item=iron-ore] and [item=copper-ore].[item=crudeic-asteroid-chunk], which can be crushed for [item=coal] and [fluid=crude-oil]. \n[item=oxide-asteroid-chunk], which can be crushed for [item=ice].\nIt is highly recommended that you review the technologies as you research them, as some have been modified from the base game. The starting technology [technology=space-platform] unlocks some advanced machines to give you a fair start.

platformer-surface-condition=All items are craftable and placeable on your platform. This means you can create [entity=locomotive] and [item=rail] systems on your platform. You can place down  [entity=iron-chest] and [entity=steel-chest] for buffering. Every production machine, including [entity=electromagnetic-plant], [entity=cryogenic-plant], [entity=biolab], [entity=recycler], and everything in between, can be crafted and build on the platform,
